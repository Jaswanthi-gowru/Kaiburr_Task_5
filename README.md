Consumer Complaint Text Classification:

This project focuses on automatically classifying consumer complaints into four categories:

1.Credit reporting, repair, or other

2.Debt collection

3.Consumer Loan

4.Mortgage

Using the Consumer Complaint Database the goal is to streamline complaint handling, improve customer support, and gain insights from large volumes of consumer feedback.

Features:

1.End-to-end text classification pipeline

2.Data preprocessing with cleaning, tokenization, stopword removal, and lemmatization

3.Feature extraction using TF-IDF vectorization

Model training with three machine learning algorithms:

1.Logistic Regression

2.Multinomial Naïve Bayes

3.Linear SVM

Real-time prediction of complaint categories

Visualization of complaint distributions and confusion matrices

Workflow:

1.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

2.Filtering relevant data, removing null entries

3.Sampling 10,000 complaints for faster experimentation

4.Visualizing complaint distribution and text lengths

5.Text Preprocessing

6.Lowercasing, removing non-alphanumeric characters

7.Tokenization and stopword removal

8.Lemmatization

9.Feature Engineering

10.Converting text into numerical features using TF-IDF

11.Model Training & Selection

12.Train Logistic Regression, Naïve Bayes, and Linear SVM

13.Evaluate using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

14.Model Evaluation

15.Analyze performance with confusion matrices

16.Compare accuracies of all three models

17.Prediction

18.Preprocess and vectorize new complaints

19.Predict category using the trained model

20.Installation
